Chess Bot Arena

This is a website that allows you to create, battle, and train against bots (Vanilla JS HTML & CSS, serverless with Ably). To get started playing against one, you will by default be in the 'main' tab. If you want to start a battle between two bots locally, simply make sure both selection boxes are unlocked, choose your bots, and press 'run'. To battle against a friend, go to multiplayer tab and create/join a room. To create a bot, either press the plus in any bot selection tab or go to the workshop. After creating a bot you can assign a template (auto populating all the functions required) or change the name (the bot's icon corresponds to it's name). Make sure to remember to press 'save' when manually editing a bots code!
