# Chess Bot Arena #

## Summary ##
This is a website that allows you to create, battle, and train against chess bots of various difficulties and ratings. It includes multiplayer functionality (Vanilla JS HTML & CSS, serverless with Ably), and a dark & light mode. All bots were handcoded by me in javascript, utilizing minimax algo no a/b pruning yet.


## Tutorial ##
To get started playing against one, you will by default be in the main tab. If you want to start a battle between two bots locally, simply make sure both selection boxes are unlocked, choose your bots, and press 'run'. To battle against a friend, go to multiplayer tab and create/join a room. To create a bot, either press the plus in any bot selection tab or go to the workshop. After creating a bot you can assign a template (auto populating all the functions required) or change the name (the bot's icon corresponds to it's name). Make sure to remember to press 'save' when manually editing a bots code!
